            <para>
                The options in <code>Settings > TubePress</code> are the global options for TubePress.
                The real power of the plugin lies in the ability to put multiple galleries on multiple pages. 
                This is done with <link linkend="shortcodes">TubePress shortcodes</link>. 
            </para>
            <para>
                For example, say on one page I want to display a gallery of videos that are tagged 
                with "<code>football</code>". On this page, I would type 
                <programlisting>[tubepress mode="tag" tagValue="football"]</programlisting>
                on the page where I want the gallery to show up. And say 
                on another page I want to display a gallery with the default (global) options that were set 
                in <code>Settings > TubePress</code>. On this page I would type <programlisting>[tubepress]</programlisting> where I 
                wanted the gallery to show up. You can follow this procedure for unlimited galleries on 
                unlimited posts/pages.  Just use <link linkend="shortcode-reference">any TubePress shortcode</link> to control the gallery content. Get creative!

            <para>
                There are no separate installation instructions; if you've <link linkend="wordpress-plugin-quick-start">installed and enabled the TubePress plugin</link>,

            <para>
                In the "Title" section of the widget control, enter the text you'd like for the sidebar's header. 
                To customize which videos show up in your sidebar, just use a <link linkend="shortcodes">TubePress shortcode</link>. Please note that 
                by default, the TubePress widget will use the following shortcode: 
                <programlisting>[tubepress resultsPerPage="3" views="false" description="true" descriptionLimit="50" playerLocation="popup" thumbHeight="105" thumbWidth="135"]</programlisting>
            </para>
            <para>
                Of course, like any TubePress shortcode, you can override any setting you like.

                If you'd like to reset your TubePress options to their default values, 
                you can do so by using a special page nested inside the plugin.

            TubePress Pro allows you to run TubePress anywhere that supports PHP5. 
            This means that you can easily insert video galleries in your PHP-enabled site! 
            A very basic understanding of PHP programming is helpful.

        <para>
            TubePress shortcodes are small snippets of text that allow you to easily control 
            the content, style, and behavior of TubePress galleries. There are very similar 
            to <ulink url="http://xavisys.com/2008/04/wordpress-25-shortcodes/">WordPress shortcodes</ulink>, with minor syntax differences.
        </para>
        <para>
            TubePress will replace any TubePress shortcode with a video gallery. Each gallery 
            can be configured completely independently from the others, based on the content 
            of the shortcode.

        <para>
            The simplest shortcode is <programlisting>[tubepress]</programlisting>
            TubePress will replace this 
            shortcode with a video gallery with the default settings. You can override each 
            TubePress setting by providing shortcode attributes, which are 
            name-value pairs that you insert between the square brackets. They all follow 
            the pattern <code>name=value</code>, where <code>value</code> is wrapped with single or double quotes (e.g. <code>foo="bar"</code>). Every TubePress shortcode is
            defined in <xref linkend="shortcode-reference" />.

                has an address of <code>http://ehough.com/?page_id=19</code> then you should add <code>tubepress_debug=true</code> to the URL to enable 
                debugging: <code>http://ehough.com/?page_id=19&amp;tubepress_debug=true</code>. The debugging information is displayed

                Some web servers place restrictions on what PHP scripts are allowed to execute. TubePress needs the ability 
                to open network connections to remote servers. One way to verify that TubePress has this ability is to run 
                the YouTube connection test. You can find a link to the test in the <link linkend="debugging">debug output</link>. The test 
                will attempt to retrieve the HTML content of YouTube's homepage, and then it will execute a sample video query 
                against YouTube's API. The result of the latter will be printed to the screen as plain XML.

            <para>
            Any page that uses TubePress needs to have <code>tubepress.css</code> and <code>tubepress.js</code> loaded in the HTML head of the document. 
            If these files are missing, your galleries will show up unstyled (ugly!) and non-functional; thumbnails won't respond to clicking on them. You can view
            your HTML source or use <ulink url="http://getfirebug.com">FireBug</ulink> to verify if these files are being loaded correctly.
            </para>
            <para>In WordPress, these files are automatically loaded via your theme's <code>wp_head()</code> function invocation. However, some custom themes
            will (accidentally or intentionally) omit this call. Switching back to the "classic" WordPress theme will verify if your custom theme is the culprit.

            <para>In TubePress Pro, you just need to make sure that you include the <code><?php print tubepressHeadElements(true); ?></code> statement somewhere in

    0. PREAMBLE
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document &#8220;free&#8221; in the sense of freedom:
    to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
    or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
    publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
    responsible for modifications made by others.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    This License is a kind of &#8220;copyleft&#8221;, which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
    sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
    should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
    does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
    for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
    published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
    works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead id="section1" renderas="sect2">
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
    under the conditions stated herein. The &#8220;Document&#8221;, below,
    refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
    and is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;. You accept the license if you copy,
    modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
    copyright law.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    A &#8220;Modified Version&#8221; of the Document means any work containing
    the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    A &#8220;Secondary Section&#8221; is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
    the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#x2019;s overall
    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
    with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The &#8220;Invariant Sections&#8221; are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
    does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
    be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
    Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
    there are none.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The &#8220;Cover Texts&#8221; are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    A &#8220;Transparent&#8221; copy of the Document means a machine-readable
    copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is
    not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is
    not &#8220;Transparent&#8221; is called &#8220;Opaque&#8221;.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
    without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
    using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
    image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
    formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
    SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
    some word processors for output purposes only.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
    material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, &#8220;Title Page&#8221;
    means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#x2019;s
    title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The &#8220;publisher&#8221; means any person or entity that distributes
    copies of the Document to the public.

  <simpara>
    A section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; means a named subunit of the Document
    whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
    following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
    for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
    &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, &#8220;Dedications&#8221;,
    &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;.) To &#8220;Preserve
    the Title&#8221; of such a section when you modify the Document means that
    it remains a section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; according to this
    definition.

  <simpara>
    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
    states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
    but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
    these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
    meaning of this License.

    2. VERBATIM COPYING
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
    notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
    Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
    measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
    exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
    may publicly display copies.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead id="section3" renderas="sect2">
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document&#x2019;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
    the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
    back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
    the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
    these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
    you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
    actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
    along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
    computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
    access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
    copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
    year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
    through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

    4. MODIFICATIONS
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
    conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
    Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
    filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
    modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
    addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
    that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
    Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
    as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
    Sections in the Modified Version&#x2019;s license notice. These titles
    must be distinct from any other section titles.

    You may add a section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various

    has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
    Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
    and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
    by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
    same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
    entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
    that added the old one.

  <simpara>
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give

  <bridgehead id="section5" renderas="sect2">
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
    provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
    of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
    Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that
    you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
    identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
    are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
    make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
    parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
    if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
    combined work.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
    &#8220;History&#8221; in the various original documents, forming one
    section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;; likewise combine any sections
    Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, and any sections Entitled

    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
    respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead id="section7" renderas="sect2">
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
    independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an &#8220;aggregate&#8221; if the copyright
    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
    the compilation&#x2019;s users beyond what the individual works
    permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
    not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
    of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
    aggregate, the Document&#x2019;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
    bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
    covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear
    on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

  <bridgehead id="section8" renderas="sect2">
    8. TRANSLATION
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
    translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
    Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
    their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
    Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
    Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
    license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
    that you also include the original English version of this License and the
    original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
    disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
    License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    If a section in the Document is Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;,
    &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;, the requirement
    (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
    changing the actual title.

    9. TERMINATION
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
    modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
    and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
    license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
    of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
    cessation.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
    permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
    reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
    violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
    you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
    License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not
    give you any rights to use it.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU

    similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns. See

    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
    the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License

    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
    any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
    Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
    by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy
    can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
