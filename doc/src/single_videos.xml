    <title>Embedding a Single Video</title>
    <para>
        There are dozens of software programs that allow you to embed an
        individual video in your web site (e.g.
        <ulink url="http://www.oembed.com/">oEmbed</ulink>,
        <ulink url="http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/wordpress-plugins/smart-youtube">Smart Youtube</ulink>,
        <ulink url="http://en.support.wordpress.com/videos/youtube/">WordPress shortcuts</ulink>).
        TubePress distinguishes itself from the competition in that it lets you easily embed a video
        <emphasis>plus</emphasis> all of the video's meta information (length, description, author,
        keywords, etc). You can even have fine-grained control over how the meta information is presented with the
        video via TubePress's <link linkend="customizing">customization abilities</link>.
        Here's an example of a TubePress embedded video vs. the competition...
        <mediaobject>
            <imageobject role="fo">
                <imagedata fileref="images/single_video_example.png" format="PNG" align="center" />
            </imageobject>
            <imageobject role="html">
                <imagedata fileref="images/single_video_example.png" format="PNG" align="center" />
            </imageobject>

        To embed a single video with TubePress, you simply use the
        <code>video</code> shortcode attribute to indicate the ID of the video you'd like
        to embed. For instance, if you want to embed the video with ID
        <code>J51kfduN5aA</code>, you would use use the following shortcode
        <programlisting>[tubepress video="J51kfduN5aA"]</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
        When embedding a single video, TubePress will use the templates located
        at <code>ui/single_video/html_templates</code>. You can adjust which
        meta information is displayed by using the regular
        <link linkend="meta-display-shortcodes">meta display shortcodes</link>. By default single
        video embeds will use <code>ui/single_video/html_templates/default.tpl.php</code>
        for a template, but you can follow the <link linkend="customizing">customization instructions</link>
        to further adjust the appearance of the embedded video and its meta
        information.
