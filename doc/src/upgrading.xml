                If your blog URL is <code>http://myblog.com</code> you'd need to navigate to
                <code>http://myblog.com/wp-content/plugins/tubepress/env/WordPress/functions/db_nuke.php</code>
                with your web browser. Once there, you can just click the <code>Reset TubePress Options</code>
                button. Of course, you'll need to be a WordPress administrator (access level 9) for your blog to
                do this.
